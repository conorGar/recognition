# SITE NAME
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

## Description
NAME is a website where creators projects speak for themselves. Users are able to both upload their own projects, and search through others, based on the skills that were used in the projects creation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this site is for users to be judged and seen based on the work they do as opposed to just what's on their resume. Users and potential recruiters are able to search for the skills they would need from someone in a project and the results would yield the highest-rated uploaded projects that used those skills. The idea is that creators who may not have the strongest resume, or qualifications on paper, will let their projects do the talking.
